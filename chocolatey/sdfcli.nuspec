<!-- Read this before creating packages: https://chocolatey.org/docs/create-packages -->
<!-- It is especially important to read the above link to understand additional requirements when publishing packages to the community feed aka dot org (https://chocolatey.org/packages). -->

<!-- Test your packages in a test environment: https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey-test-environment -->

<!--
This is a nuspec. It mostly adheres to https://docs.nuget.org/create/Nuspec-Reference. Chocolatey uses a special version of NuGet.Core that allows us to do more than was initially possible. As such there are certain things to be aware of:

* the package xmlns schema url may cause issues with nuget.exe
* Any of the following elements can ONLY be used by choco tools - projectSourceUrl, docsUrl, mailingListUrl, bugTrackerUrl, packageSourceUrl, provides, conflicts, replaces 
* nuget.exe can still install packages with those elements but they are ignored. Any authoring tools or commands will error on those elements 
-->

<!-- You can embed software files directly into packages, as long as you are not bound by distribution rights. -->
<!-- * If you are an organization making private packages, you probably have no issues here -->
<!-- * If you are releasing to the community feed, you need to consider distribution rights. -->
<!-- Do not remove this test for UTF-8: if “Ω” doesn’t appear as greek uppercase omega letter enclosed in quotation marks, you should use an editor that supports UTF-8, not this one. -->

    <summary>This is an installer app for the NetSuite SDF CLI tool, I will keep this as up-to-date as possible (specifically during major releases from NetSuite. Dependencies are [JDK8](https://chocolatey.org/packages/jdk8) and [Maven](https://chocolatey.org/packages/maven) (they will autoinstall).</summary>
    <description>This is my first chocolatey package, so please forgive the crudity (I've never written in PowerShell).

    This is merely a script that follows the installation instructions from the [NetSuite Help Center](https://system.eu1.netsuite.com/app/help/helpcenter.nl?fid=section_1489072409.html) (requires login). The installation directory is: C:\Users\YOURUSER\sdfcli and is only available to the user installing the product.

    I do not own the rights to SDF, those rights are included in the attached license.

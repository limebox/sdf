<!-- Read this before creating packages: https://chocolatey.org/docs/create-packages -->
<!-- It is especially important to read the above link to understand additional requirements when publishing packages to the community feed aka dot org (https://chocolatey.org/packages). -->

<!-- Test your packages in a test environment: https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey-test-environment -->

<!--
This is a nuspec. It mostly adheres to https://docs.nuget.org/create/Nuspec-Reference. Chocolatey uses a special version of NuGet.Core that allows us to do more than was initially possible. As such there are certain things to be aware of:

* the package xmlns schema url may cause issues with nuget.exe
* Any of the following elements can ONLY be used by choco tools - projectSourceUrl, docsUrl, mailingListUrl, bugTrackerUrl, packageSourceUrl, provides, conflicts, replaces 
* nuget.exe can still install packages with those elements but they are ignored. Any authoring tools or commands will error on those elements 
-->

<!-- You can embed software files directly into packages, as long as you are not bound by distribution rights. -->
<!-- * If you are an organization making private packages, you probably have no issues here -->
<!-- * If you are releasing to the community feed, you need to consider distribution rights. -->
<!-- Do not remove this test for UTF-8: if “Ω” doesn’t appear as greek uppercase omega letter enclosed in quotation marks, you should use an editor that supports UTF-8, not this one. -->

    <summary>This is an installer script for the NetSuite SDF SDK / CLI tool, I will keep this as up-to-date as possible (specifically during major releases from NetSuite. Dependencies are [JDK8](https://chocolatey.org/packages/jdk8) and [Maven](https://chocolatey.org/packages/maven) (they will autoinstall).</summary>
    <description>NOTE FOR UPGRADING FROM 18.2.0: Given the recent changes to the "Save Token" functionality, before upgrading from 18.2.0, make sure you go to the installation directory and move the .clicache file to your user directory. This will keep your tokens from being overwritten with this and future upgrades. This is note a required step, but not doing so will reset tokens on your local environment.

    Also, since multiple version may be needed if you work in multiple environments, a new folder structure was created in 19.1.0 that will keep the two latest versions for easy switching.

    This is an installer script that follows the installation instructions from the [NetSuite Help Center](https://system.netsuite.com/app/help/helpcenter.nl?fid=section_1489072409.html) (requires login). The installation directory is: C:\Users\YOURUSER\sdfcli and is only available to the user installing the package.

    I do not own the rights to SDF, those rights are included in the attached license.

    This release is not compatible with Oracle-NetSuite 18.2.x, do not upgrade SDF SDK if your NetSuite Environment has not been upgraded.

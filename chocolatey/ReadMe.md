NOTE FOR UPGRADING FROM 18.2.0: Given the recent changes to the "Save Token" functionality, before upgrading from 18.2.0, make sure you go to the installation directory and move the .clicache file to your user directory. This will keep your tokens from being overwritten with this and future upgrades. This is note a required step, but not doing so will reset tokens on your local environment.

This is an installer script that follows the installation instructions from the [NetSuite Help Center](https://system.netsuite.com/app/help/helpcenter.nl?fid=section_1489072409.html) (requires login). The installation directory is: C:\Users\YOURUSER\sdfcli and is only available to the user installing the package.

I do not own the rights to SDF, those rights are included in the attached license.

This release is not compatible with Oracle-NetSuite 18.2.0, do not upgrade SDF SDK if your NetSuite Environment has not been upgraded.

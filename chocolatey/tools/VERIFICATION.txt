VERIFICATION
Verification is intended to assist the Chocolatey moderators and community
in verifying that this package's contents are trustworthy.

The jar files for the SDF CLI can be found here:
https://system.netsuite.com/download/ide/update_18_1/plugins/com.netsuite.ide.core_2018.1.2.jar
https://system.netsuite.com/download/ide/update_18_1/plugins/com.netsuite.ide.eclipse.ws_2018.1.2.jar

The com.netsuite.ide.eclipse.ws_2018.1.2.jar file is unpacked for this project using the command:
jar xf com.netsuite.ide.eclipse.ws_2018.1.2.jar

This produces the two supporting files that are included in this package:
/axis.jar
/NetSuiteWebService.jar

Given the special case of how this application needs to be executed (using Apache Maven and JDK), the unreliability of the available file on their server, and when/if they lock it behind a password, I have opted to including the .jar file in this package.
